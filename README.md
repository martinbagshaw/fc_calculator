# JavaScript Calculator  
 - A JavaScript Calculator built as part of pre-course materials for Founders &amp; Coders Course.  
 - Calculator is visually (and functionally) similar to the native apple mac calculator.
 - Takes keyboard input. Use `0` to `9` and `.` to enter numbers, `SHIFT` + operator keys (`/`, `*`, `-`, `+`)  
  for operations, `ENTER` to perform calculations, `BACKSPACE` to delete a number in the display, and  
  `SHIFT` + `R` to clear the calculator.
 - Uses `const c` object to store the running total, the latest operator, and to make calculations. 

## To do:
 - Refactor and reduce the amount of code, and make the style more consistent.
 - Was considering shrinking font size to fit larger numbers on the display (as per the native apple  
 mac calculator), feels like a nice-to-have embellishment though.
