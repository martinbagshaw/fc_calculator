# JavaScript Calculator  
 - A JavaScript Calculator built as part of pre-course materials for Founders &amp; Coders Course.  
 - Calculator is visually (and functionally) similar to the native apple mac calculator.

## To do:
 - Store values in calculations (operators and numbers) in objects rather than data attributes.  
 This should help to [improve performance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes#Issues).
 - Make `DEL` and `=` buttons take keyboard input (as with numbers 0-9 and .). Operators (* / + -)  
 will prove more tricky, perhaps a solution could be to press and hold the `SHIFT` key.
 - Refactor and reduce the amount of code, and make the style more consistent.
 - Was considering shrinking font size to fit larger numbers on the display (as per the native apple  
 mac calculator), feels like a nice-to-have embellishment though.
